#Part A

##Cutscenes

###Alarm Clock Going Off
Yeah so it starts with the sweet sweet sounds of his alarm going off because he
has to get up to go to work.

###Professor Cane looking triggered
Maybe he can be screaming, or just looking like he remembers his time in vietnam
all too well, even though he wasn't there.

###him walking down the hall
You can see some things on the wall like his ethnobotany degree and maybe a
picture of some kind of family or something.

###pouring a bowl of vegan cereal
yeah I guess this guy is a hippie.
>Soy Chuckles:the Cereal that is Both Ethically Conscious *and* Fun<br />
>Nutritional Information:None Present

###Car zooming to school
yeah it can be purple I reckon, because that sounds pretty groovy. and also
maybe it should run on grapeseeds or something weird.

##Gameplay
You are professor Cane driving to school and you get some kind of bonus for
killing animals, but if you hit a person you get arrested.
