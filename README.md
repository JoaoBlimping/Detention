#Detention! - the Family Favourite Corporal Punishment Game

##Concept
You are Professor Cane, you used to research **ethnobotany** or some other
thing where you get to take **a lot** of drugs, but then you took too many drugs
and destroyed the university so now you are a school teacher who hates the kids
because they are filthy **normal people**.
Every friday it's mad cos the scripture teacher comes and you can go to your
back room and drink scotch, but then the scripture teacher catches you and takes
your scotch so now you have to break out the emergency cane and kill all the
kids to get to the scripture teacher and kill him too and then drink your
scotch.

##Gameplay
It's a top down zelda-ish kinda thing, but with less puzzles and more killing
school kids.

picture of some kind of family or something.
